BSF 3 beta2 Release Notes
-------------------------

Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which
provides scripting language support within Java applications, 
and access to Java objects and methods from scripting languages.

From version 3 BSF has been developed according to the JSR-223
specification but has not yet been tested via the JSR-223 TCK.
BSF can therefore not be considered a compatible implementation
of JSR-223.

Changes in the beta2 release
----------------------------

The beta2 release is an incremental improvement over the first
beta release fixing several incompatibilities in the BSF API
for the JSR-223 specification, as well as providing support for
the latest releases of various languages such as Groovy 1.1, 
JRuby 1.0.1, and Jython 2.2.1.

While the beta2 release mostly maintains backward compatibility
with the beta1 release with respect to client APIs and script
language engine releases there is one breaking API change in the 
javax.script.Invocable interface. The invokeFunction and 
invokeMethod methods on that interface now throw an additional
checked exception, java.lang.NoSuchMethodException. Therefore 
client code using those methods must be updated when moving up
to the BSF3 beta2 release.
