BSF 3 beta3
-----------

The BSF 3 binary release contains several jars:

bsf-api-beta3.jar
- this contains all the javax.script classes as defined in the
  JSR-223 specification. This jar may be used as an application 
  dependency when the application is using javax.script classes

bsf-engines-beta3.jar
- this contains several JSR-223 script engine implementations 
  which enable a script language to be used via the javax.script
  APIs. This jar does not include the actual script language 
  implementations, these need to be obtained separately.

bsf-utils-beta3.jar
- this contains various BSF specific utilities which aid using
  script languages from Java applications. 

bsf-all-beta3.jar
- this contains all the other BSF jars merged into a single jar for 
  ease of use. If you're not sure which jar to use then use this one.

BSF 3 is compatible with Java 1.4.2 and above. Specific script 
languages may have further requirements on the Java version.
