This demo shows how one can use LotusXSL as a scripting language to
fill in a Java data structure using some XML data and a stylesheet.

To run it, type:

	java TableFiller style1.xsl table-data.xml
or
	java TableFiller style2.xsl table-data.xml

You need to have LotusXSL v0.18.* on your classpath in addition to 
bsf.jar and bsfengines.jar.
