	To build BSF3.0rc , one needs the followings:
	
		- Servlet API.jar via Tomcat or other source 
		
		- Supporting language .jar files:
			Rhino -> http://www.mozilla.org/rhino
		
	Make sure the .jars (and Ant) are in your CLASSPATH, and then 
	use	the	command

    	ant [target]

	where [target] is one of the following:

		- compile 	-> creates the "bsf.jar" package in "./build/lib"
		               (default target)
	 	- bindist	-> creates the complete binary distribution
	 	- srcdist	-> creates the complete source distribution
	 	- dist		-> creates both binary and source distributions
	 	- javadocs	-> generates the docs for the whole package in 
	 	               "./dist/javadocs"
