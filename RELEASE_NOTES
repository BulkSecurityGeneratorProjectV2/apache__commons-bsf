Apache BSF 3 Beta3 Release Notes
--------------------------------

Apache BSF 3 is an implementation of JSR-223, the Scripting for the Java Platform APIs.
Note that this software hasn't been tested with the JSR 223 TCK, and therefore is not a 
compatible implementation of JSR-223.

This 3.0-beta3 release is a maintenance release update to support for the latest releases
of various script language engines.
